Smart Water Level Monitoring System – README
📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a simple Water Level Monitoring System using an ultrasonic sensor and Arduino. The system helps monitor the water level in an overhead tank and provides visual and audio alerts using LEDs and a buzzer.

This solution helps prevent unnoticed low water levels and allows maintenance staff or students to take timely action.

💡 Features

Real-time water level measurement using an ultrasonic sensor.

LED indicator alerts for medium and low water levels.

Buzzer alert when water level is critically low.

Simple and low-cost prototype suitable for school demonstration.

🛠 Components Used

Arduino Uno

Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

trigPin → 7

echoPin → 6

LED Indicators

Level1 (medium level) → Pin 11

Level2 (critical low) → Pin 10

Buzzer / Alert LED → Pin 2

Jumper wires

Breadboard

⚙️ How the System Works

The ultrasonic sensor sends sound waves and measures the distance to the water surface.

Based on distance readings:

10–15 cm → Level 1 LED turns ON
(Indicates medium water level)

<10 cm → Level 2 LED + Buzzer activate
(Indicates critical almost full level)

>15 cm or safe zone → All alerts remain OFF
